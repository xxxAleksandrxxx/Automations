It has two modes:  
- Share sheet mode: This mode opens the file for editing and then prompts the user to enter a file name and choose a folder to save it in. If the file name and file path are the same, the existing file will be overwritten; otherwise, a new file will be created.  
- Run from Shortcuts: In this mode, the file is opened for editing and any changes made are automatically saved to the selected file.  

I would like to have the same logic for those two modes or to swap between the two modes, but I didn't find how to retrieve the full file path from the share sheet mode. If anyone knows, please share your wisdom ðŸ˜Š
