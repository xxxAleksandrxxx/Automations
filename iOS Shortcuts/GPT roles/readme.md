If you want a quick response from ChatGPT by openAI using roles and minimal interface interruptions, this shortcut is likely what you're after.  

I built it for personal use to simplify my conversations with chatGPT as Python student and Spanish student and found this useful.

Inside shortcut you will find detailed comments within the code blocks, enabling you to grasp its functionality and customise it to align with your vision. 


p.s.: if you like the shortcut and want to support me, feel free to **<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/usern34582">buy me a coffee</a>** ðŸ˜Š

### Settings
Once you've copied the shortcut, all you gotta do is:
- Choose your home folder where the API key and answer file will be located  
- adjust roles to your needs

Home folder | Dictionary with roles | Request to API | File with answer
- | - | - | -

If you don't need local file with the last answer you can just delete the last two code blocks.
If you do so, it would be possible to avoid usage of any local files by adding text block with API key direct to the Shortcut like so:  

delete | delete | add
